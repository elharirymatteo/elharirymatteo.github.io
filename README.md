## About Me

Hello! I'm Matteo, a passionate PhD Researcher at the University of Luxembourg and a Machine Learning Engineer. 

My current research focus is on improving Reinforcement Learning algorithms (RL) in the context of autonomous complex robotic systems.


I have a Master in Computer Science and Engineering (AI track) from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/international-prospective-students/laurea-magistrale-programmes-equivalent-to-master-of-science/programme-catalogue/computer-science-and-engineering), and a double BS degree from PoliMi and [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/).

While building strong foundations in Machine Learning, complex systems dynamics, and related subjects through formal education, I like to pursue my interest in human behavior and psychology by reading and learning about social dynamics, individual and collective intelligence. My drive is to build and understand AI technologies to explore the high-complexity landscape of decision-making, in ways that are novel to humans and potentially beneficial to tackling [humanity most pressing world problems](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/).
Here's how you can restructure the "Research & Projects" section of your GitHub.io page to match the style shown in the screenshot:

## Research & Projects

### AIRSHIP Project

As part of an EC-funded consortium, I'm working on the development of autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) strategies for the innovative Unmanned WIG Vehicle (UWV). This involves:

- Simulation and implementation of GNC strategies.
- Deployment of RL-based policies to autonomously maneuver UWV, focusing on enhancing speed, flexibility, and energy efficiency.

For more information, check out [airship-project](https://airshipproject.eu/).

### Autonomous Systems for Space and Terrestrial Robotics
