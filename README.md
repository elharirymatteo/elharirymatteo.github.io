## About Me

Hello! I'm Matteo, a passionate PhD Researcher at the University of Luxembourg and a Machine Learning Engineer. My journey is at the fascinating intersection of technology and the human experience, with a special focus on leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for autonomous navigation in space and terrestrial robotics.

With a background in computer science, complex systems dynamics, and a keen interest in human behavior and psychology, I've been driven to explore how AI technologies can not only solve technical challenges but also mirror the complexity and adaptability of human decision-making.

## Research & Projects

### AIRSHIP Project
As part of an EC-funded consortium, I'm working on the development of autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) strategies for the innovative Unmanned WIG Vehicle (UWV). This involves:

- Simulation and implementation of GNC strategies.
- Deployment of RL-based autonomous maneuvers for UWV, focusing on enhancing speed, flexibility, and energy efficiency.

### Autonomous Systems for Space and Terrestrial Robotics
My research work includes applying ML and RL in various contexts to improve autonomy in robotic systems.

- **ReiNforcement Learning for undeactuated satellite attitude control:** Developing RL-based attitude controllers for nanosatellites.
- **DRIFT: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Floating Platforms Trajectories:** Autonomous floating platforms using Deep Reinforcement Learning to perform high precision position and orientation control under dynamic and uncertain disturbances.
