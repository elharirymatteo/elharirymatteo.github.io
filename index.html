            <p>Hello! I'm Matteo, currently a PhD Researcher at the University of Luxembourg.</p>
            <p>My research focus is on improving Reinforcement Learning algorithms (RL) in the context of autonomous complex robotic systems.</p>
            <p>
                Previously, I worked for 3+ years as a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.argotecgroup.com/">Argotec</a>, 
                an aerospace company specializing in micro-satellites for Deep Space. I contributed to the core algorithms used 
                for the autonomous visual navigation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LICIACube">LICIACube</a> and 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArgoMoon">ArgoMoon</a>, satellites that were part of NASA's 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Asteroid_Redirection_Test">DART</a> and 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_I">Artemis I</a> Missions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a Master’s in Computer Science and Engineering (AI track) from 
                <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/international-prospective-students/laurea-magistrale-programmes-equivalent-to-master-of-science/programme-catalogue/computer-science-and-engineering">Politecnico di Milano</a> 
                and a double BS degree from PoliMi and <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/">Tongji University</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                While building strong foundations in Machine Learning, complex systems dynamics, and related subjects through formal education, 
                I like to pursue my interest in human behavior and psychology by reading about social dynamics, individual and collective intelligence. 
                My drive is to build and understand AI technologies that can explore decision-making in ways novel to humans and potentially beneficial 
                for tackling <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/">humanity's most pressing world problems</a>.

            As part of an EC-funded consortium, I'm working on the development of autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) strategies 
            for the innovative Unmanned WIG Vehicle (UWV). This involves:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simulation and implementation of GNC strategies.</li>
            <li>Deployment of RL-based policies to autonomously maneuver UWV, focusing on enhancing speed, flexibility, and energy efficiency.</li>
        </ul>

            Developing RL-based attitude controllers for nanosatellites.
            This work, done while being at Argotec, investigates the use of Reinforcement Learning for satellite attitude control. In particular, the aim was to find control policies for two working conditions: the nominal case, in which all the actuators (a set of 3 reaction wheels) are working properly, and the underactuated case, where an actuator failure is simulated randomly along one of the axes.
